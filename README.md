This version of the code is the original code for the paper. I think it was compiled on windows using Geany (and likely a c compiler from cygwin or some type of visual studio, codeblocks or some other weird windows environment I was using at the time. I tested it today on linux using geany again but it does not seem to compile correctly.

TODO: update the code with proper Makefiles and build on Linux so that the results are easily repdroducible.
