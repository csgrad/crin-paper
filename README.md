### November 25 - 2nd Commit ###
Updates were made so that the code runs using a Makefile and gcc. It was tested and runs correctly in Linux. I assume it will also compile properly in a cygwin environment in windows. Currently tested with Ubuntu 15.10 and gcc-4.9.2.

### November 25 - 1st Commit ###
This version of the code is the original code for the paper. I think it was compiled on windows using Geany (and likely a c compiler from cygwin or some type of visual studio, codeblocks or some other weird windows environment I was using at the time. I tested it today on linux using geany again but it does not seem to compile correctly.

TODO: update the code with proper Makefiles and build on Linux so that the results are easily repdroducible.
