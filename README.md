# crin-paper
This repository has the source code that was developed for the two papers aiming to help solve the FPGA placement problem. I was a co-author early in my MSc and wrote all of the code for the papers and contributed to some of the algorithmic and implementation specific details in the paper. "[Customized reconfigurable interconnection networks for multiple application socs](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4629991)" and "[Algorithms and implementation for interconnection graph problem](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-85097-7_19)"

Updates were made so that the code runs using a Makefile and gcc. It was tested and runs correctly in Linux. I assume it will also compile properly in a cygwin environment in windows. Currently tested with Ubuntu 15.10 and gcc-4.9.2.

This version of the code is the original code for the paper. I think it was compiled on windows using Geany (and likely a c compiler from cygwin or some type of visual studio, codeblocks or some other weird windows environment I was using at the time. I tested it today on linux using geany again but it does not seem to compile correctly.
